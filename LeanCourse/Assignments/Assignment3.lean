section Surjectivity

/- Lean's mathematical library knows what a surjective function is,
but let's define it here ourselves and prove some things about it. -/

`simp` is a very useful tactic that can simplify many expressions. -/

to the left and the right, the result will still be a
surjective function. The `ring` tactic will be very useful here! -/

there is no surjective function from any set to its power set.
Hint: use `let R := {x | x ∉ f x}` to consider the set `R` of elements `x`
that are not in `f x`
-/
